# Keeping conversations and the system prompt on disk

Two opt-in functions of `strata --serve` write a checkpoint to disk and read it back instead of reading a prompt
again: the **disk tier** keeps a conversation the RAM cache evicts, and the **system-prompt cache** keeps the
checkpoint that ends the system prompt. Both are off by default. With no flags, the engine behaves exactly like
upstream. Every flag is listed in [FLAGS.md](FLAGS.md).

## Why this helps

A long chat that comes back after a few turns is not free: the engine has to hold, or re-read, the history in
front of the new message. Upstream keeps that in host RAM (`--conversation-cache-mib`), but the RAM cache is
bounded and does not survive a restart. The disk tier closes that gap: a conversation is written to a folder as an
ordinary session file, and a later request — or a restart — reads it back instead of reading the whole prompt
again. The file is the same format the manual slot save/restore API writes, so a spilled conversation and a
hand-saved one are interchangeable.

The tier has two modes (`--conversation-cache-spill-on`). The default, **mirror** (`park`), writes the state the
moment a request ends and its session is parked, so an abrupt close loses at most the request in flight. The
opt-out, **overflow** (`evict`), is the delta-1 behaviour: only a conversation the RAM cache evicts reaches disk.
In both modes the folder holds **one copy per conversation**, and the copy is only replaced once its successor is
on disk.

The system prompt in front of every chat is (for one client) the same on every new chat, and it can be thousands
of tokens. Re-reading it costs time on the first request of each chat. The system-prompt cache persists the
checkpoint at the end of that prefix, so a new chat reads only what comes after it. It is a resume point for the
prefix, never a conversation tail.

## Slot lifecycle

A slot is one request's state. When its turn ends the state is parked; the RAM cache holds it, and the disk tier
mirrors it (default) or catches what the RAM cache drops (`evict`). The write happens when a request **ends**,
never mid-generation, and a burst of parks of one conversation collapses to its newest state: one cell per
conversation, drained by one background writer.

    A --> X{"Request cancelled? (the engine's '(cancelled)')"}
    X -->|yes| Y["Provisional: revert the live ids to the last turn boundary; publish nothing; previous copy untouched (archive the PRE-revert ids)"]
```

**Compaction.** The sidecar carries the conversation's own token ids, so the check needs no K/V. A stored copy
whose common prefix with the incoming prompt is shorter than `--conversation-cache-spill-divergence-tokens`
(4096 by default) **while its header still matches** describes a history the client has rewritten (a compaction or
an edited history): it can never be a hit, so it is discarded — index and file — and counted (`compacted`). A copy
the prompt extends is the normal turn and is kept; a copy whose header differs is another conversation and is left
alone.

**Cancellation.** A request the client aborts (Escape-Escape in a TUI) ends with the engine's own `(cancelled)`
line. That state is provisional: the live ids are reverted to the last turn boundary the read actually reached
(`--turn-token`), no durable copy is published of it, and the previous good copy is left exactly as it was — it is
the prefix the client resends on the retry. The harness does not matter: the decision uses only the turn token and
the engine's cancellation signal.

**Archive instead of discarding (opt-in, delta 5a).** By default the three paths that discard the parking copy —
the compaction above, the copy a re-park supersedes, and the provisional state of a cancelled request — remove it.
With `--conversation-cache-archive-mode ids` (or `state`) the tier **moves** the copy into a subdirectory
(`--conversation-cache-archive-dir`, default `<spill-dir>\archive`) instead of removing it. `ids` keeps only the
sidecar (the token and image ids, no K/V); `state` moves the session file — the K/V included — with its sidecar.
The cancellation path archives the state **before** the revert, so it keeps the tokens the request actually
produced (archiving after the revert would store a copy identical to the previous one). The archive is **never a
reuse candidate**: its entries are not in the tier's index, so `best()` cannot return one — it is evidence and
recovery, and a client that reverts a compaction can restore it in `state` mode. It has its **own** budget
(`--conversation-cache-archive-mib`) and its **own** GC (per-conversation `keep`, then the budget, oldest first,
plus `--conversation-cache-archive-max-age-days` if set), separate from the tier's `--conversation-cache-disk-mib`;
the tier's GC never touches the archive and the archive never counts as a tier eviction.

**Risk and retention of the archive.** The archive keeps what the tier would have deleted, so it is a larger and
longer-lived exposure surface. It is **plaintext**: the `.meta` holds token ids and image keys and, in `state`
mode, the `.sess` holds the whole K/V. There is **no encryption** and **no secure delete** — removal is an ordinary
file unlink. Keep the archive folder as private as the spill folder (restrictive permissions, private volume) and
set a retention rule deliberately: `--conversation-cache-archive-keep` (copies per conversation),
`--conversation-cache-archive-mib` (byte total) and, optionally, `--conversation-cache-archive-max-age-days`. With
`-max-age-days 0` (the default) an archived copy persists as long as it fits the byte budget: there is **no
deletion by time** unless you ask for it. A conversation whose archived copy alone exceeds `-mib` is **not
archived** (it is discarded exactly as without the archive): the archive's budget is never exceeded by one copy.

## Prefill decision tree

A new prompt is first offered to the live slots and the RAM cache; only then to the disk tier. A disk match is
loose (a common prefix), and the candidate is restored only if the exact prefix passes; otherwise the prompt is
read normally.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["A prefill arrives"] --> B{"A live slot or the RAM cache reaches it?"}
    B -->|yes| C["Hit in RAM: reused, disk untouched"]
    B -->|no| D["Match on disk, from the sidecars only (no K/V read)"]
    D --> E{"Common prefix passes similarity and n-min?"}
    E -->|no| F["Miss: normal reprocessing"]
    E -->|yes| G{"Model / config identity and KV type match?"}
    G -->|no - another model, another quant, another build| H["Rejected clean: ignored and counted, not reused"]
    H --> F

    I -->|no| F
    I -->|yes| J["Validate header / hash, load, grow or compact"]
    J --> K["Hit: only the tokens after the prefix are processed"]
```

## System-prompt variants

The cache does not hold one system prompt but a small set of variants. A variant is keyed by the exact hash of
its system-prompt token prefix (plus `--system-prompt-cache-key` and the model/config identity), so only a prompt
that begins with exactly those tokens can attach it.

```mermaid

    A["New chat"] --> B["Hash its system-prompt token prefix"]
    B --> C{"A variant with that hash exists?"}
    C -->|yes| D["Hit: load the stored root, process only the tokens after it"]
    C -->|no| E["Miss: reprocess from the start and write the new prefix as its own variant"]
    E --> F["The old variant is kept: it is a hit again if the client returns to it"]

    G --> I["By age: --system-prompt-cache-max-age-days, oldest first; 0 = never"]
    H --> J["A variant never dies because the system prompt changed"]
    I --> J
```

## Use and limits

**Turn it on.**

- Disk tier: `--conversation-cache-spill-dir DIR`, with `--conversation-cache-mib > 0`, `--prompt-cache > 0`,
  `--conversation-cache-slots > 0` and a nonzero `--conversation-cache-disk-mib` (default 8192 MiB).
  `--conversation-cache-spill-on` chooses `park` (default once the tier is on: a mirror, written at the park) or
  `evict` (the delta-1 overflow);
  `--conversation-cache-spill-when-full` chooses `evict-oldest` (default) or `reject`;
  `--conversation-cache-spill-max-age-days` adds optional age pruning (0 = off);
  `--conversation-cache-spill-divergence-tokens` (4096) and `--conversation-cache-spill-park-throttle-s` (0) tune
  the compaction check and the rewrite rate.
  The **archive** is opt-in and off by default: `--conversation-cache-archive-mode ids|state`
  (`--conversation-cache-archive-dir`, default `<spill-dir>\archive`; `--conversation-cache-archive-mib`, default
  2048; `--conversation-cache-archive-keep`, default 4; `--conversation-cache-archive-max-age-days`, default 0 =
  no retention by time). With the mode `off` nothing is archived and nothing is created: the tier is
  **byte-for-byte identical** to the behaviour without these flags.
- System-prompt cache: `--system-prompt-cache` with `--system-prompt-cache-dir DIR`. It also needs
  `--prompt-cache > 0`, `--prompt-cache-root > 0`, a turn token and `--mtp` (without MTP the feature reports
  itself off rather than capturing a different artifact). Its folder is separate from the spill folder.

Both can be set in a config's `args` and edited from the Settings page (see `serve/runconfig.py`). The Monitor
shows their counters under `/metrics` in `conversation_cache` (`disk` and `system_prompt_cache`).

**Limits.**

- The disk tier works with `--layer-split`: one session file per stage plus one joint sidecar.
- The system-prompt cache works with `--layer-split` too, the same way: one session file per stage under the
  variant's key, and a joint sidecar holding the stage count (its sidecar is version 2; a version 1 file, the
  single-file form, is still read). It also loads a variant whose K/V was stored while the engine kept part of
  the context in host RAM.
- A disk hit is read into host RAM before it is restored: it must fit `--conversation-cache-mib` and leave the
  `--conversation-cache-min-free-mib` floor available, or the request reads the prompt normally.
- The scan never deletes. A file of another identity, a broken or missing sidecar, an orphan session file and a
  leftover temporary are ignored and counted (`foreign`, `stale`, `orphan`), never removed. Only the GC removes,
  by budget and (if enabled) by age, oldest first.
- Nothing is written with the flags absent: no folder is created and no byte is written. The mirror writes at the
  **end of a request** (the park), never mid-generation, and collapses a burst of parks of one conversation to its
  newest state; the disk cost is bounded by `--conversation-cache-disk-mib` either way.
- The **archive** (`--conversation-cache-archive-mode`, delta 5a) is off by default: with `off` the tier is
  **byte-for-byte identical** to the behaviour without the archive flags (no directory, no byte, counters at 0).
  When on it keeps what the three discard paths would destroy, in its own subdirectory, with its **own** budget and
  GC, separate from the tier's `bytes_`/`disk_evictions`/age levers. It is **never a reuse candidate** (`best()`
  cannot return one) and it **does not speed up** any read. `state` costs like a session file per copy (~30 KB/token
  at the measured geometry), so bound it with `--conversation-cache-archive-mib`. The archive must not be the spill
  folder itself (refused at start, so its entries can never be indexed as reuse candidates). It is **plaintext and
  has no secure delete** (see the risk note above); retention is `-keep` + `-mib` + optional `-max-age-days`, and a
  copy that alone exceeds `-mib` is not archived. In a cancelled request the archive always keeps the pre-revert
  **ids only** (the `.meta`), never the K/V, even in `state` mode: the `--conversation-cache-archive-mode` row of
  FLAGS.md states exactly that.
- The **mirror** pays a host copy of the parked image per park (the writer owns its own copy, so the RAM cache's
  entry is never aliased). The copy is synchronous at the park; the disk write itself is asynchronous.

## Validation environment

- The session-file numbers below were measured on an **RTX 4070 Ti (12 GB), Ryzen 9 5900X, 64 GB RAM, NVMe ext4,
  IQ3_XXS**, on a 63,025-token conversation, with engine 0.1.38 carrying the session-file change (binary sha256
  `3bbe4fc3...`). They measure the **session-file SAVE/RESTORE path**, which the spill reuses; they are not a
  measurement of the automatic spill.
- The KV-streaming figure (~13.7 KB of RAM per context token) is measured on the setups in
  [DETAILS.md](DETAILS.md#speed-measured) (KV streaming, engine 0.1.5; ~1.7 GB at 128K).
- The layer's own host-only tests (conversation cache / memory / file / spill / prompt cache) build and pass with
  `-DSTRATA_BUILD_CONVERSATION_TESTS=ON`. That is a correctness check, not a speed measurement.

## Measured benefit

**Session files (what both functions write).** On the setup above, a 63,025-token conversation is a **1.20 GB**
file: **save 0.65 s**, **restore 1.05 s** in a new engine process, and the next 32-token turn then takes
**1.14 s** (1.00 s for the same turn without a restart). The cold first turn of that conversation takes 25.5 s.
The file reported `n_written = 1,198,691,396` bytes, that is **about 19,019 bytes per token** at this geometry.
Each extra checkpoint is about **118 MB**. These are single runs.

**KV streaming.** Holding the context's K/V in host RAM costs about **13.7 KB per context token** (1.7 GB at
128K). This is the dominant term when sizing a spill folder.

**This layer, end to end.** There is **no measurement yet of the disk tier or the system-prompt cache with the
model loaded**: no hit rate, no tokens saved, no per-turn latency. The counters exist (hits, misses, tokens saved,
bytes, live variants, evictions by space and age, hash changes) and are logged at start and at shutdown; they have
not been read from a real run.

## Sizes by KV type

The KV cache is the part that scales with its type. `int8` is the type measured here; `f16` and `q4_0` are
**derived** from it by the nominal width (f16 = 2 bytes/value, int8 = 1, q4_0 = 18 bytes per 32 values = 0.5625),
so they are estimates, not measurements. The derivation ignores the per-block scale bytes and does not separate
the parts that do not scale with the KV (running state, checkpoints); treat them as a lower bound on the total
disk a folder will use.

Measured `int8` anchors: **~14,029 B (≈13.7 KB) per context token** for the KV in host RAM (streaming), and
**19,019 B per token** for the session file on disk (63,025 tokens → 1.20 GB).

| KV type | KV in host RAM (B/token) | 17k | 63k | 384k | Session file on disk (B/token) | 17k | 63k | 384k |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **f16** | ~28,058 *(derived)* | ~455 MiB | ~1.65 GiB | ~10.0 GiB | ~38,038 *(derived)* | ~617 MiB | ~2.23 GiB | ~13.6 GiB |
| **int8** | ~14,029 *(measured)* | ~227 MiB | ~0.82 GiB | ~5.0 GiB | 19,019 *(measured)* | ~308 MiB | 1.20 GB *(measured at 63,025)* | ~6.80 GiB |
| **q4_0** | ~7,891 *(derived)* | ~128 MiB | ~0.46 GiB | ~2.8 GiB | ~10,698 *(derived)* | ~173 MiB | ~0.63 GiB | ~3.83 GiB |

Sizes are powers of 1024 (MiB, GiB) except the measured 1.20 GB, which is the decimal figure upstream reports.

## Non-claims

- **Attention is causal.** A token's K/V was computed against the system prompt that was in front of it, so the
  tail of a conversation (its K/V) cannot be kept under a _different_ system prompt: everything after the
  divergence is **reprocessed**. If the change is at the **end** of the system prompt, only the tail is paid; if it
  is at the **beginning**, everything after it is paid.
- A file from **another model or another configuration** (including **another KV quant**) is **rejected**, not
  reused. The same identity check that guards the slot save/restore API guards the spill.
- The disk tier **does not speed up the path that already reuses**. It does not fix the per-turn cost and it does
  not change VRAM residency; those are `--kv-resident` and the slot count (`parallel`). The disk tier only avoids
  re-reading a prompt that would otherwise be read again.
- There is a real, documented case in the field in which a client that **mutates the head of the prompt** (a
  per-request attribution/version block) destroys reuse: the system-prompt prefix hash changes every request, so
  every request is a miss. The cache does not fix that; it makes it visible (a `hash_changes` counter).
- **There is no end-to-end measurement yet** with the model loaded. The hit rate, the tokens saved and the
  per-turn latency of these two functions have not been read from a real run.
